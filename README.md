## Public Dataset Release Calendar Dates (rolling)
=========================

A rolling, comprehensive schedule of regularly scheduled and special release datesets from various federal and state entities, so that journalists/researchers can stay on top of latest available data dumps and analyize, clean and visualize them in a timely manner. Kind of like the U.K.'s [Office for National Statistics](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/release-calendar/index.html?&newquery=*&releaseDateRangeType=next12months&pageSize=50&applyFilters=true&sortBy=releaseDate&sortDirection=ASCENDING), but for the U.S.as well as other international governmental data releases.

Contributions welcomed and encouraged. Some basic notes for contributions:
+ Either manually list out the scheduled data release dates, or link to an iCal, RSS feed, public Google Calendar or other database with the release date infortmation.
+ Master schedule will be available in this repo to download and import into the calendar service of your choice in all formats once a critical mass of scheduled releases have been gathered.
